# AlveusDB

AlveusDB will be a database for storing and querying data from Arma Reforger Mods and probably more.

## Disclaimer

This is a work in progress and is not ready for use. I am not a database expert and this is my first attempt at creating a database. 
I am also learning Rust as I go so the code is probably not the best. I am open to suggestions and pull requests.

## Goals

* Easy interface for adding data to the database over HTTP
* Easy interface for querying data from the database over HTTP
* Good performance
* Easy to use
* Easy to install
* Easy to use for Arma Reforger mods using the built-in Web Request Module(which is broken at the moment)
* Rules for adding data to the database to prevent bad data from being added

## Non-Goals

* Security (because it won't be open to the public and only accessible from the local network)
* Data encryption (because it won't be open to the public and only accessible from the local network)
* Data compression (for now at least because we don't have that much data)

## How to use

For now, you can't. I am still working on it.
